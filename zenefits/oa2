Zenefits: Flip 0 or 1
You are given an array a of sizeN. The elements of the array area[0], a[1], ... a[N - 1], where each a is either 0 or 1. You can perform one transformation on the array: choose any two integers L,and R, and flip all the elements between (and including) the Lth and Rth bits. In other words, Land R represent the left-most and the right-most index demarcating the boundaries of the segment whose bits you will decided to flip. ('Flipping' a bit means, that a 0 is transformed to a 1 and a 1 is transformed to a 0.)

What is the maximum number of '1'-bits (indicated by S) which you can obtain in the final bit-string?

Constraints:. 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000d can be either 0 or 1. It cannot be any other integer.0 ≤ L ≤ R < N
Sample Input:
8
10010010
Sample Output:
6
Explanation:We can get a maximum of 6 ones in the given binary array by performing either of the following operations:Flip [1, 5] ⇒ 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0or
Flip [1, 7] ⇒ 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
