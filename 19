1. faster + runner (faster is k step further, then when faster get to None, slower get to the right position)

class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        superHead = pre = ListNode(0)
        pre.next = fast = slow = head
        for i in range(n):

            pre = slow
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        pre.next = slow.next
