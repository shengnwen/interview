O(N), O(1)â€¨use dummy node and keep pre node unchanged

class Solution(object):
    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        if n - m < 1:
            return head
        superHead = ListNode(0)
        pre = superHead
        superHead.next = head
        for i in range(m - 1):
            pre = pre.next
        start = pre.next
        then = start.next
        for i in range(n - m):
            start.next = then.next
            then.next = pre.next
            pre.next = then
            then = start.next
        return superHead.next

handle reverse is tricky here, keep start, pre, then unchanged point to the same node (the first reversed one)
